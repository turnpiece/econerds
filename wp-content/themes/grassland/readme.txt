Wordpress theme created for Spectacu.la themes club. (http://www.spectacu.la)

1:	Unzip this and upload into your wordpress's /wp-content/themes/ folder.

2:	There is a file in the working folder that can be used to re-export all the graphic elements for the theme. Allowing you to customise the theme
	quickly and easily. The PNG file with all its export slices was created in fireworks 8, I have no idea if the file will work the same way in 
	anything other than FW8.

3:	Please don't try to pass this work off as your own, by all means add your credit to ours if you change the theme but don't try and pass the whole 
	thing off as your own work.
	
4:	We can't provide free support for customisation and the theme in general. However if you do have any problems with the theme please contact us via 
	the forum on http://www.spectacu.la/forum/ and we will see what we can do for you.

5:	If this theme doesn't do what you want we can build you a completely custom theme at a competitive rate that will be yours and 	yours alone. We 
	offer hosting and support for the themes produced for you. This service is provided by http://interconnectit.com, spectacu.la's parent company.
